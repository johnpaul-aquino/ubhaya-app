Hi Viola,

I wanted to share an exciting update on the Ubhaya platform development. We've completed the **Admin Panel** - a comprehensive back-office management system that gives you full control over your platform.

## What's New: Admin Panel Features

### 1. Admin Dashboard Overview
A central hub showing key metrics, recent users, organizations, and quick action buttons for common tasks.

## Payment & Deployment

To proceed with production deployment, please settle the following:

| Remaining development balance | $2,000 USD |
| Hosting credits (DigitalOcean) | $100 USD |
| Domain registration (Namecheap) | $20 USD |
| **Total** | **$2,120 USD** |

Once payment is received, I will:
1. Create a shared Gmail account for managing cloud services
2. Deploy the application to production (DigitalOcean)
3. Purchase and configure the domain (Namecheap)
4. Set up DNS records
5. Configure AWS S3 for file storage (free tier)

Please let me know if you have any questions about the admin panel features or the deployment process.

For any future development or new features, I'm available as a freelance developer.

Best regards,
